# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Titanic-Dataset-
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). The project includes statistical summaries, data visualizations like histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and insights on survival patterns.
# 🚢 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python to uncover insights, trends, and patterns related to survival.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files Included
- Titanic_EDA_Report_PDF.pdf – Final analysis report with visualizations and observations.
- titanic_eda.ipynb – (Optional) Jupyter Notebook with the full Python code.
- titanic.csv – Titanic dataset (optional if required).
- README.md – This file.

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Countplot of Survival
- Boxplot of Age by Pclass
- Heatmap of Correlation Matrix
- Histogram of Fare Distribution

## 🔍 Key Insights
- *Higher survival rate* observed in 1st class and among females.
- *Fare* has a positive correlation with survival – passengers who paid more were more likely to survive.
- *Age distribution* varies by passenger class.
- *Pclass* and *Fare* are significant indicators of survival.

## ✅ Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in using EDA techniques to analyze real-world datasets and generate meaningful business insights using data visualization.
